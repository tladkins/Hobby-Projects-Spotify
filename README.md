# Spotify Application Project

Using the application:
1. Create the database in SQL Server using the provided .sql file.
2. Insert the correct Client and Client Secret Keys for your account.
3. Insert your server for the connection string.
4. Run the Spotify_Storage_App.py in the environment of your choosing.

Other Important Notes:
1. The query to retreive the top row will not work the first time you run the application. To fix this add a row to the table. You can delete this later if you want.
